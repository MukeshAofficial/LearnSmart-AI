This will help the reader to understand the scope of your work and the value that you bring to an organization. Third, you should proofread your resume carefully for any errors. There are a few typos and grammatical errors in the resume, which could make a negative impression on the reader.

Overall, your resume is well-written and well-structured. With a few minor improvements, it will be even more effective in helping you to land your dream job. I would give it a score of 7 out of 10.
